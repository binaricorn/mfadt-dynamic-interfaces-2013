These examples are designed to get you a little more comfortable with JS. JavaScript is a lot like Processing. A quick translation matrix:

If in Processing you wrote this...

	int myInt = 5;
	float myFloat = 5.5;
	String myString = "Hi!";

	void someFunction() {
		// do something here.
	}

And now in JS:

	var myInt = 5;
	var myFloat = 5.5;
	var myString = "Hi!";

	function someFunction() {
		// do something here
	}
