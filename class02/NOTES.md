### JavaScript Primer

We went through the basics of JS using [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.com) to quickly prototype. Check out the demo files to get a rehash on most of what we covered.

The most important takeaway is that JS is in many respects and easier programming language to learn than Processing. It can be so easy in fact that you can trip over it - changing the type of variable from an int to a string without even realizing it is a common beginner gotcha.

### Hot Key Primer

Remember: **learn the hot keys**. They'll make you a much more efficient and confident computer user.

Most Hot Keys are similar and obvious from program to program. 
	
* Command+N will always open something new
* Command+O = open.
* Command+W = close.
* Command+Tab = switch to a different program

If you're on OSX perhaps [Cheat Sheet](http://osxdaily.com/2012/05/23/see-all-keyboard-shortcuts-apps-mac-cheatsheet/) is a good app for you. On Windows [KeyRocket](http://www.veodin.com/keyrocket/) looks like a nice option.

### NodeJS Redeux

We created a server from scratch again and while many of you are still getting your sea legs on how to do it, we can now see that things like:
	
	require("http");

Are not different from

	setInterval(update,1000/30);

Or

	add(1,3);

Just functions that do stuff for us.

## Homework

1. Make the box bounce around the frame in JSFiddle. You've already got it moving across the screen.
1. Think about realtime multiuser interaction and come up with a proposal for doing something new/innovative/crazy with it.
